### git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

**What it does:**
Applies the changes from a specific commit onto your current branch.

**Narrative:**
You may want to bring in a single useful commit from another branch without merging the whole thing. This command is perfect when you only need a specific fix, feature, or update from someone else's work.
